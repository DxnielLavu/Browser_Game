MAY REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE HARDWARE ACCELERATION ON IN YOUR BROWSER

In this game, use your vertical mouse movement to control your paddle and hit the ball back and forth. Try and hit the ball until the AI misses and the first person to get 3 points wins.

Bugs: If the ball hits the far back corner of the paddle theres a chance it
will go inside and bounce out.
